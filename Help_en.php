</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
	Delete a field

<p>
	<i>User Profiles</i> helps you configure how the users access to the information, and if they can modify it.
</p>
<p>
	RosarioSIS comes with four groups as profiles: Administrator, Teacher, Parent &amp; Student. The Administrator Profile has the most permissions, and the other profiles are restricted as appropriate. Please note that teachers are limited in access to the students scheduled in their classes, and that parents can only see the information of thier children, and that students can only see their personal information.
</p>
<p>
	If you click on one of the Profiles, you will see the Permissions Page. This page shows to which page(s) the profile has access to READ (Can Use) or to WRITE (Can Edit) the information on that particular page.
</p>
<p>
	When you uncheck "Can Edit", the users belonging to the profile will see the program in the menu and will see data on the page when clicking on it. They will NOT be able to change any of that information on that page. When you uncheck "Can Use" on a particular program, then users belonging to the profile will not see the program in the menu on the left hand side, and will not be able to access it.
</p>
<p>
	Administrator Profile
</p>
<p>
	Administrators have access to almost all pages, to read or to write information on that page. By default, they cannot see the "Comments" tab in the Student Info program, but can access and can modify all other pages.
</p>
<p>
	You can restrict the User Profile edition if you uncheck the <i>Users > User Info > General Info > User Profile</i> checkbox. Administrators will then loose the ability to assign user profiles (and permissions).
</p>
<p>
	You can restrict the User Schools edition if you uncheck the <i>Users > User Info > General Info > Schools</i> checkbox. Administrators will then loose the ability to add or remove schools to/from a user.
</p>
<p>
	Teacher Profile
</p>
<p>
	Teachers have the permission to access a more limited set of pages within RosarioSIS, and their ability to edit those pages is more restricted. By default, teachers cannot change any data about a student EXCEPT for the Comments tab.
</p>
<p>
	Parent Profile
</p>
<p>
	Parents are even more limited. Parents only have access to information that is specifically of interest to them, the student's demographic information, attendance and grades.
</p>
<p>
	Add a User Profile
</p>
<p>
	For security reasons, it is recommended to add an "admin" profile to "Administrator" in order to limit the permissions of administrators. It should not be necessary for ALL administrators to be able to Add Schools, Copy Schools, change Marking Periods, or change Grading Scales, etc. Once the configuration of the school is done, changes to the configuration by unknowledgable users can be a source of troubles or dysfunctions.
</p>
<p>
	To add a new Profile, type its name in the "Title" text box and then select its "Type" of profile. Finally, click the "Save" button in the upper part of the screen.
</p>

	The Calculate GPA program calculates the weighted GPA earned per course by multiplying the GPA value of the grade earned by the GPA multiplier of the course weight. Then, it divides that value by the number you specified as the base for your weighted scale. For unweighted GPA, the Calculate GPA program simply takes the GPA value of the grade the student earned. After finding the GPA points earned for each course, the program averages these values to determine the student's to-date GPA. It then sorts these values to determine the class rank. If more than one student has the same GPA, they will share a position in class rank.

	You can configure the gradebook to round scores up, down, or normally. Normal rounding would round 19.5 to 20 but 19.4 to 19.
</p>
<p>
	You can also configure the score breakoff points for each letter grade. For example, if you set the score breakoff points for A+, A, and A- to 99, 91, and 90 respectively, a student with 99% to 100% would have an A+, another student with a 91% to 98% would have an A, and a student with a 90% would have an A-. The score breakoff point for F should probably be 0.
</p>
<p>
	Finally, you can also configure the final grading percentages of each semester. These values are used when averaging the quarter grades to calculate the semester grade.
